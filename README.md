- 👋 Hi, I’m Atul Mohan. I did my PhD in Solar physics. Bulk of my research uses radio interferometric observations of the solar atmosphere.
- 👀 I’m interested in radio interferometric observations of the Sun and stars, star-planet interaction, solar/stellar winds and activity.
- 🌱 I use casa 6 and python for coding and analysis. I plan to use to use GitHub and share my routines/packages/modules and invite collaborations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building tools and techniques for handling big data, data reduction/condensation to extract science relevant information 
- and to develop tools of data representation to aid scientific discoveries. I would also like to collaborate with teams wanting to use radio interferometric 
- big data sets for scientific goals or machine learning.
